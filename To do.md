TO DO
-----

* Powerups(Longer paddle, multiple balls, etc.)
* Sounds/music
* Main menu/game over/level select/options screens
* Particles(drop from brick when hit, ball trail, etc.)
* Score system
* Local leaderboards
* Different types of bricks(i.e. Hard bricks that take 2 hits to break, indestructible bricks, etc.)
* Make the ball actually a circle internally and adjust collision accordingly, might be more work than its worth
